This is a website to plan SAS Core classes for Rutgers students. 
You can search for courses that satisfy certain combinations of requirements, add/remove them to/from your list of courses, and track your progress in meeting the different requirements.

To get started, have docker installed on your computer and run the following in your terminal:

docker pull sanjeevh219/sas_core_planner:latest

docker run -p 8080:8080 sanjeevh219/sas_core_planner:latest

Finally, while the backend is running, go to https://sanjeevh1.github.io/sas_core_planner/frontend/register.html to create an account and start planning.
